Computations Performed on the original data:

-- Combine test and train data
-- Remove all other readings than mean and standard deviation (using the name)
-- Replace the type of exercise by the descriptive name
-- Compute aggregate mean for each subject and each activity


The first two columns are the Subject Id and the Exercise Type. Rest of the columns are the same as the original data from the assignment.
